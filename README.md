# Ardvark Westlook: High School Tycoon

This is a top-down 2D resource management game where you take on the role of Principal, managing the high-pressure environment of a private prep school based (parodically) on Harvard-Westlake. From hiring teachers to outwitting the menacing Dean Prescado, your job is to balance chaos, pressure, and prestige in pursuit of academic dominance.

## 🎓 About the Game

As principal, you control the budget, the staff, the schedule, and the policies. But not everyone is on your side. Dean Prescado, the school's terrifying enforcer of attendance and order, is always lurking, ready to undermine your plans with surprise audits and disciplinary showdowns.

## 🛠️ Gameplay Features

### Strategic Resource Management
- Balance your **budget** between staff salaries, facility upgrades, and extracurricular funding.
- Manage your **rep** trying to calm angry parents, stop student uprisings and grow as a school, using your philanthropic donations to actually expand.
- Schedule **classroom use** wisely to avoid student burnout and overcrowding.
- Recruit teachers with unique traits, from gossip-prone drama instructors to overzealous gym coaches.

### Dynamic Student Simulation
- Every student has unique stats like GPA, stress level, social group, and "college pressure" tendencies.
- Average GPA and stress are kept track of as well. 
- High stress leads to rebellion, while low GPA brings down your school’s prestige.

### Adversarial Administration
- Dean Prescado roams the halls enforcing attendance and rules.
- Challenge him in PTA meetings, distract him with bureaucracy, or try to outmaneuver him in secret.
- He is the lead instigator of student stress, and cancelling activities of extracurriculars you may have implemented. 

## 🧪 Special Systems

- **Tiger Spirit Meter**: Boost school morale with rallies, scandal coverups, and timely pizza parties.
- **Legacy Mode**: Woo alumni donors and unlock OP buildings like the “Altruism Atrium.”
- **Underground Network**: Explore secret tunnels for hidden perks, lost items, and conspiracy hints.
- **Crisis Events**: Handle surprise college rejections, prank wars, and “I’m a legacy!” meltdowns.

## 📈 Progression

Advance through academic years, expand your campus, and take on increasingly difficult student populations. Harder student populations introduce more rep sensitivity, potentially shooting your school up on the leaderboard, or allowing it to fall to the floor.

## 🎯 Endgame Goals

- Build a second campus and open a second coop prep school empire
- Defeat Dean Prescado and take full control of the school
- Automate everything and hire people to manage certain programs
